## First Program
```py
print("Hello Python!")

```   

Let's first use IDLE. Before run this code, you have to save it first and remember the file name has to end with **.py**. Or you can press `F5` and save it. Then a Python Shell will pop up and it look like this:


In fact, you can also run codes inside the Shell, which is also known as **REPL** normally, when you finish one-line code and press enter, you will get an output immediately. 

```py
>>> print("Hello Python")  
Hello Python  
>>>
```
